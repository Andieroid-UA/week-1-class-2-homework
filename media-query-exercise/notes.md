Notes:
services - now about
testimonials - now projects
main-content-contact
======================================
STUCK:

-By default (for desktops/large screens): .about and .contact sections should take up 25% of the container's
width and float to the left and right respectively. .projects section should take up 50% of the container's width
and float in the middle.
======================================
To Do:
-Use a clean, readable font from Fonts. Define a pleasant color scheme for your site. Style the header, sections, and footer with padding and margins for a clean look
